  <LongDescription># Even Better Save List

The original inspiration and infrastructure came from [Better Save List][bsl], so this mod uses the same LICENSE. Thanks to the author for their hard work.

Since [Better Save List][bsl] had not been updated for a long time, I rewrote Even Better Save List to provide better save interface functionality.

This mod groups saves by city name and collapses them, making the save page more logical and easier to manage large numbers of saves. Sorting options are provided for city names and individual saves to help users select and find saves.

## Compatibility

Obviously, you cannot use this mod together with [Better Save List][bsl], and it cannot be used with any mods that modify the save page.

This mod will not break your save file, and can be temporarily disabled in the options.
